                    <a href = "https://www.ocean-prime.com/" target="blank"><img src = "/assets/pictures/ocean-prime.jpeg" alt = "Ocean Prime"/></a>
                    <p>A high-end establishment serving steak, seafood, and specialty cocktails in Desert Ridge's "High Street" galleria. If you're willing to spend a pretty penny, 
                        this is one of the top options in the valley for a night of fine dining. Their crab cakes are spectacular, and their portion sizes are adequate but never 
                        excessive. For an extra bit of fun, check out the "Berries & Bubbles" cocktail, which is poured over dry ice for an entertaining effect.</p>

                    <h3>Humble Bistro</h3>
                    <a href = "https://www.humblebistro.com/" target = "blank"><img src = "/assets/pictures/humble-bistro.jpeg" alt = "Humble Bistro"/></a>
                    <p>Staying on High Street, a close runner up for the top spot on this list is the cozy Humble Bistro, which lives up to its name visually with an understated 
                        brick-and-barnwood motif, yet pairs it with warm Italian comfort food and a lovely wine selection. House-made pasta and delectably simple sauces will leave you 
                        comfortably sated, and if you add a glass of wince you may well need a cab to carry your sleepy ass home! Their take on the classic pasta dish Cacio e Pepe is 
                        the best I've ever had, but you can't go wrong with any of their pasta options.</p>

                    <h3>State 48 Brewery</h3>
                    <a href = "https://www.state48brewery.com/" target = "blank"><img src = "/assets/pictures/state-48.jpeg" alt = "State 48"/></a>
                    <p>State 48 - not to be confused with the (also excellent) clothing brand - has a number of valley-wide locations, but for my money the original DTPHX location 
                        is the best, with a spacious dining room directly across the street from The Van Buren concert venue on the outskirts of the city. It has a funky rock-inspired 
                        theme, excellent burgers, sandwiches and pub grub, and a wide array of local brews of all varieties. My personal pick is the Corned Beef Reuben, but be ready; 
                        Their sandwiches are sizeable!</p>

                    <h3>Islands Fine Burgers and Drinks</h3>
                    <a href = "https://www.islandsrestaurants.com/" target = "blank"><img src = "/assets/pictures/islands-burgers.jpg" alt="Island's"/></a>
                    <p>A regular staple of my dining-out options in the Valley of the Sun, Islands offers classic American with a polynesian twist; think Red Robin with more pineapple.
                        affordable pricing a large portions make this a good family option, especially if your family would like to share a plate of nachos, as Islands is maybe the best 
                        spot to get them.</p>

                <li class = "list-item">
                    <h3>Top Shelf Mexican Food & Cantina</h3>
                    <a href = "https://topshelfmexicanrestaurant.com/" target = "blank"><img src = "/assets/pictures/top-shelf.jpg" alt = "Top Shelf"/></a>
                    <p>Another mid-price family option located in Peoria, Top Shelf is a good spot for a variety of classic Tex-Mex options. Though their food can be a bit on the 
                        greasy side, sometimes that's what you're after! Their bar is also adorned with a number of TV's set to available sports programming, though there is a 
                        separate dining room if you would like Grandpa to pay attention to the family during dinner. Be forewarned, however - Thursday's are karaoke night, 
                        so you won't catch me there, unless I can't resist getting Burrito Fundido take-out!</p>

                    <h3>Chez Nicely</h3>
                    <a href = "chez.html"><img src = "/assets/pictures/chez-nicely.jpg" alt = "My Kitchen"/></a>
                    <p>On second thought... let's not go to Chez Nicely. 'Tis a silly place.</p>
