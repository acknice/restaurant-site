        <h2>I don't really have anythng to eat... wanna order in?</h2>

        <p>While I have a pretty nice kitchen, I'm not much of a cook and I don't care for greocery shopping. As a result, supplies are a little light.</p>

        <p>On second thought, let's just <a href = "list.html">find somehwere else to eat...</a></p>
