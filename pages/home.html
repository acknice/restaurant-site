            <p>At the behest of my coding instructor, I have whipped up this little site to provide the low-down on my favorite places to eat in the Phoenix Metro Area, my hometown!</p>

            <p>I have provided here a vast variance of venerable victuals, with prices ranging from <span>"Sure, I guess..."</span> to <span>"No way!"</span> and (not nearly) everything in between!</p>
